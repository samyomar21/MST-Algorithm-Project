Project Description:

- algorithm1.py: Naive solution (using DFS for cycle detection).
- algorithm2.py: Optimized solution (using Union-Find data structure).
- main_gui.py: It provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to visualize the buildings, execute both algorithms.
- Final_Report.pdf: Documentation of the project.
